# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is something that you use in a javascript document that allows you to manipulate data.  For example, you can write a function that will tell your computer to take in a list of numbers and multiply each of them by 3.  A more advanced function would be telling your computer to take any amount of words and return them to you as Pig Latin.

#### 2. What is a method?
A method can help you change the layout of the data you have entered into javascript.  There are so many methods that each have a different purpose.  We can use a method to turn a string into an array and then another to turn it back into a string.  There's a method that allows you to search any amount of data to find all of the instances of a string, like "qu" or "abcd."

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
Some of the string methods I've used the most are .toLowerCase() which will turn all of text in your variable to lower case letters.  You can also use .length() to find the length of items in a variable or .indexOf() to find the index of a certain element in your variable.

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
An accessor method is just like it sounds, it is used to access date within an object and also known as a getter.  Mutators are also just as they sound.  They're used to manipulate or 'mutate' data.  They are also known as a setter.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
Console log is used to physically log something to your computer.  For example, if I console.log('Hi, my name is Kyle!'), when I pull up my webpage and inspect it, you will be able to see it logged.  Return on the other hand is very useful when we're writing conditional statements, such as an if/else, because as soon as we add a 'return' to the end of it, it cuts off (or finishes) the if/else statement in this particular example.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
Everything so far has been super helpful!  This assignment was for last week (oops), but I think that it was very cool to see the whiteboarding done this week.  I hope to experience it soon so that I can see what it's all about!
